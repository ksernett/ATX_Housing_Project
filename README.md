# Rising Rates and Housing impact in Austin

### Team Members   
This project was created in collaboration with two team members: 
* Ankita Sarkar    
* Justin Bernier    

###  Overview
The objective of this project is to see if the raising of the federal funds rate is having an impact on the real estate market in the greater Austin, TX area. Many know Austin, and other major metropolitan real estate markets, have been hot and a sellers market the last few years. Real estate prices have been going up significantly in 2020 and 2021, mortgage originations and refinances have been high, and housing inventory in market has been decreasing. Inflation in 2022 and other macroeconomic factors have contributed to the increase in the federal funds rate, from historic lows to numbers we have not seen in well over a decade.  Is this having an impact in real estate and what might the trend be in 2023?  

**Hypothesis**  - Fed rate increases are impacting the Austin real estate market by slowing it down. 

###  Outcomes

###  Conclusion
There appears to be a correlation between the fed rate, mortgage rates, median home price sales, and housing inventory indicating a slowing housing market as federal fund rates continue to go up.
